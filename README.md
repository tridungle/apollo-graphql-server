After the popularity of my [Next.js and Apollo post](https://medium.com/@tomanagle/create-a-server-side-rendering-graphql-client-with-next-js-and-apollo-client-acd397f70c64) I decided to write a guide on creating a GraphQL server.

The guide takes you through four steps:
1. Basic setup
2. Database setup
3. Mutation setup
4. Subscription setup

These are the main building blocks you will need to get started with building your own GraphQL servers.
